# After-Change Checklist

After implementing or changing code, also do the following:

## Tests

- Add or update unit/integration tests for new or changed behavior.
- Keep coverage and `__tests__/` structure in line with the project (see `__tests__/README.md` in this repo).

## Comments / JSDoc

- Update or add JSDoc/comments where behavior or public API changes.
- Follow the project JSDoc style (see `jsdoc-style.mdc` in this folder).

## README

- Update `README.md` (and any app-specific docs) when setup, scripts, environment variables, or the surface area of the app changes.

## Legal / static pages

- If the change affects data handling, cookies, auth flows, or product behavior, consider updating legal pages where they exist (e.g. `app/impressum/`, `app/privacy/`, `app/terms/`).

## Shared-code repos (helvety.com, helvety-auth, helvety-pdf, helvety-store)

- After editing any file listed in `shared-code-patterns.mdc`, run the shared-code sync from **helvety.com**: `node scripts/sync-shared.js`, then run format/lint/tests in each target repo (as noted in the main README).
