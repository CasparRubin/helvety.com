- **Server Layout Guards** - Authentication checks in Server Components via `lib/auth-guard.ts` (CVE-2025-29927 compliant)
- **Redirect URI Validation** - All redirect URIs validated against allowlist via `lib/redirect-validation.ts` to prevent open redirect attacks
- **CSRF Protection** - Token-based protection with timing-safe comparison for state-changing operations
- **Rate Limiting** - In-memory rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- **Idle Timeout** - Automatic session expiration after 30 minutes of inactivity
- **Security Headers** - Comprehensive CSP, HSTS, and other security headers
- **Audit Logging** - Structured logging for authentication events

### Cross-Subdomain SSO

Sessions are shared across all `*.helvety.com` applications via cookie-based SSO. Authentication is handled centrally by [auth.helvety.com](https://auth.helvety.com).
